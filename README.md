### Description
This R package provides tools for estimating ventilation rates in indoor environments, crucial for understanding and mitigating airborne disease transmission risks such as COVID-19. It implements the Build-Up Method and the Transient Mass Balance Method, adapted to analyze time-series CO2 data.

### Key Features
- **Build-Up Method**: Utilizes increases in CO2 concentration to estimate air exchange rates without steady state assumptions.
- **Transient Mass Balance Method**: Employs a mass balance model for CO2 in an occupied room to estimate air exchange rates.
- **Robust Data Analysis**: Functions to calculate running averages, variances, and identify periods of CO2 concentration growth or decay.
- **Flexible Input**: Accommodates various inputs including CO2 data, room volume, and number of individuals.
- **Simulated Data Testing**: Capabilities to test the methodology using simulated data under varying conditions.

### Current Progress
- Development and testing of the Build-Up Method algorithm.
- Algorithm for identifying exponential growth and decay in CO2 concentrations.
- Simulated CO2 data generation for algorithm testing.
- Ongoing testing and optimization.
