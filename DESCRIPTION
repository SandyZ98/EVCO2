Title: Estimating Ventilation Rates with CO2
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Thomas Cooper; Chendi Zhao; Abigail Mauger
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: The aim of the package is to use time series data of CO2 to calculate room ventilation rate. Our methodology will follow the “Build-Up Method” and “Transient Mass Balance Method” from Batterman[10] to estimate air exchange rates. From this air exchange rate, we can solve for the room ventilation rate.
